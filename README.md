This was a basic app for testing open graph meta tags to see if there were a way to dynamically modify them. For example to show different og images for different sections of our application. I do not think this is possible with the way these tags are being scraped by the applications that use them. There may be some way to create a separate static page just for scrapers, but was not a direction I wanted to go with this.
